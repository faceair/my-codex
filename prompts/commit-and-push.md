# Commit & Push

Goal: Commit current work with meaningful commit boundaries and push cleanly.

Rules:
  - Use standard git plus GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands for PR/review operations.
  - Inspect the current repo and PR state before choosing commit messages, PR titles, PR bodies, or review replies.
  - Prefer repository conventions and existing templates when present.
  - Create meaningful commit boundaries: split unrelated changes into separate commits and keep each commit focused.
  - Use Conventional Commits for all new commits (`type(scope): summary` or `type: summary`; types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, perf, build, ci, style).
  - Use explicit push logic: check upstream with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{upstream}`; if absent, run `git push --set-upstream origin HEAD`, else run `git push`.
  - Execute commands non-interactively and continue until the requested outcome is complete.
  - For multi-line content passed to GitHub CLI, write it to a temp file or heredoc and use `--body-file` instead of inline multi-line `--body` text.
  - If a command fails, resolve the issue and retry rather than stopping early.

Steps:
  1. Inspect the current diff before choosing commit boundaries and messages.
  2. Commit all uncommitted changes in meaningful commit(s): split unrelated changes, keep each commit focused, and use concise imperative messages grounded in the diff.
  3. Push explicitly: run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{upstream}`; if it fails, run `git push --set-upstream origin HEAD`; otherwise run `git push`.

Done:
  - The working tree is clean.
  - The branch is pushed to origin (with upstream configured if needed).

Reply: Briefly report the commit(s) you created and confirm the push completed.

Ship it: commit and push.
